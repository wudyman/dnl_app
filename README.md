## Application Architecture

- [Microsoft Code Push](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push) for dynamic update.
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) is a predictable state container for reading application, together with [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).
- [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga/) is a library that aims to make side effects in reading application easier and better.
- [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) is an extensible yet easy-to-use navigation solution, can also be used across React and React Native projects allowing for a higher degree of shared code.
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) components and UT.
- [Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in reading application code.
- [react-native-exceptions-manager](https://github.com/Richard-Cao/react-native-exceptions-manager) for handling crashes in release version.
